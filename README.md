# web_advisor_v2

## Abstract

The app should roughly serve the same purpose as the class search page on Gustavus's WebAdvisor, with some additional features and some features missing. The user should be able to search for classes based on class title, instructor, department, area approval, course level and number, time, and description keywords. The user should be able to save classes to a personal "collection" for future reference. The app should query the list of all class sections on the Gustavus web page for up-to-date information. It should also query RateMyProfessor and provide information about the professor for each class, if available. 

## Narratives

All narratives are written from the perspective of a Gustavus student, since they currently seem to be the only users of WebAdvisor's class search function.

"Class registration can be really confusing and stressful. It's hard enough finding course requirements on the Gustavus website - and then once I do know what classes I want, WebAdvisor makes it hard to find those classes. I have to click through half a dozen links and logins in order to even get to the search screen, and then the screen itself is a little intimidating. The search function isn't very forgiving, and the results display is just kinda ugly. I'm not totally sure how to save classes, and it's annoying that I have to keep clearing my cookies when I use it. I wish there was a simpler way to search for classes."

"WebAdvisor is fine for the most part, but I don't always have access to a computer when I want to search for classes and it's really annoying to try to use it on my phone. I wish I could just bring up the course listings quickly with an app, search through them just like I can on WebAdvisor, and save them for later."
